**CSC316 – Final Project**

## **Project Overview**

**What**: Your final project will be done in teams of 5-6. This project has a major emphasis on creative visualization design and storytelling. You'll work together with your team to create a compelling visual data story on a topic of your choosing. You will use the design sprint process and map your project, explore the data, sketch your visualizations, develop your data story, implement it using D3, and evaluate the results.

Your project will require you to design **two novel visualizations** that don’t just replicate existing chart types (e.g. bar, pie, line). This is your opportunity to apply the creative design principles that you’ll learn in class\!

You will host your final project as a public website using GitHub Pages or any other web hosting service of your choice (we strongly encourage you to use GitHub).  
   
**When**: Here is the schedule of deliverables. All project milestones are due on Fridays (except for the final presentation and final submission).


| Week | Main Tasks | Submissions  |

| Week 13 | Presentation | **Apr 2: Final Presentation In-Class\!** |
| Week 14 | Final Submission | **Apr 6**: Final Submission,  Self and Peer Group Assessment |

**Teams**: You will pick your own team of 5-6 students to work with. In general, we do not anticipate that the grades for each team member will be different. However, we reserve the right to assign different grades based on peer assessments. **Communication is key\!** You should make good faith efforts to reach out to your teammates and to respond in a timely manner. You'll also draft a team agreement early on in the project that will set expectations and guidelines for how to collaborate. 

**Mentor:** We will assign a TA mentor for each team in week 4\. Your mentors will guide you throughout the semester, giving you feedback at each milestone of the project. You'll also have the chance to meet with them during the tutorial sessions in weeks 4, 9, and 11\.   
   
**Topic**: You will pick your own topic and dataset. There are no hard rules, but you should choose a topic that interests you and that would make for a compelling data story.   
   
**Design & Implementation**: You will follow the design sprint process and use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and D3 for your implementation. 

**Remote Collaboration Tools**: We encourage you to use digital whiteboarding software such as [Miro](https://miro.com/) to create your storyboards and map out your ideas.

## **What to do**

Throughout the semester, you will complete milestones that help you advance the design and implementation of your project. These will be documented in your **process book**. Your process book is a Google Doc organized into tabs. Each tab contains the template and instructions for a particular week. 

Here is an overview of the deliverables for each week; for more details on each, see the instructions in the process book.

**Week 2: Team formation, agreement, & project proposal*

* Form your groups\! The project leader should fill out the [Google form](https://forms.gle/5SHtnL5GALs7cQxR8) for group signups.
* You’ll develop a proposal for your topic, including: a title, abstract, and proposed dataset(s).  
* You’ll also write an initial Team Agreement so that your group is on the same page.
* At this point, while you should have an initial idea for your project, you are free to refine, modify, or change completely in the coming weeks.

**Week 3: Map & Data Exploration**

* **Background and Motivation.** Discuss your motivations and reasons for choosing this project, especially any background or research interests that may have influenced your decision.  
* **Related Work.** Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, website, and visualizations we discussed in class.  
* **Audience and Questions**. Describe your audience and the primary questions you are trying to answer with your data story. Do you have any overarching goals and objectives that you want to accomplish?  
* **Data**. From where and how are you collecting your data? If appropriate, provide a link to your data sources.  
* **Data Cleanup**. Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup? What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How will data processing be implemented? Try to minimize the amount of cleanup you have to do by finding cleaned and ready-to-go data sources whenever possible. 
* Create exploratory visualizations of your dataset to get a better sense of what you’re working with.  
* Reflect on the results of your exploration and how it will affect your project.

**Week 6: Sketch, Storyboard, & Prototype V1**

* Sketch creative visualization ideas that answer the various questions you’ve come up with so far.  
* Decide on which sketches to implement.  
* Create a storyboard that shows how a viewer will experience your data story.
* Create a first bare-bones visualization prototype. You do not have to have all your visualizations up and running, and it does not need to be completely interactive, but the overall structure and the content should be visible. We will ask you to hand in your code in its current state. 

**Week 10: Prototype V2**

* We expect you to be 95% done with the implementation of your project. It should be ready to be tested by a random person the following week. 

**Week 11: Test**

* You will conduct a think-aloud study with a random person from another team that we will assign to you. You will document the results of the study and use them to make changes to your prototype. 

**Week 13: Final Presentations**

* Present your hard work on November 25\! At the end of class, the TAs will award the Best Project Prizes :)

**Week 14: Wrap Up & Submission & Peer Assessment**  
You will finalize your web-based data story and submit your final project on **April 6th**. You will host your final project as a public website using GitHub pages or any other web hosting service of your choice (we strongly encourage you to use GitHub). You’ll also submit your process book, code, data, and a narrated screen-cast of your project. Finally, you will fill in the self and group peer assessment form.

## **What to submit**

Be sure to check the course calendar for when you are having a "project week" (weeks in which project milestones are due do not coincide with weeks in which class assignments are due). Export the relevant tab of your process book as a PDF and upload it to Quercus. Some weeks you will have to upload separate files as well (such as your data or code).

**At the end of the final project**, your team will submit the following items in a single .zip file:

* **Process book**: a link to your Google doc, that documents every step and design decision of your final project.   
* **Data:** Submit all the cleaned data that you used in your project. If the data is too large to upload, store it on a cloud storage provider such as Dropbox or OneDrive.   
* **Code**: All web site files and libraries assuming they are not too big to include.  
* **Final Project Video**: A max. 2-minute screencast with narration that shows how your audience would go through your data story.   
* **README** \- The README file must give an overview of what you are handing in: which parts are your code, which parts are libraries, and so on. The README must contain URLs to your project websites and screencast videos. The README must also explain any non-obvious features of your interface.

## **Grading rubric**

We will grade your milestones each week based on how well you document your process and address the prompts in the process book. At the end of the semester, your final project submission will be graded by your mentor, plus a second TA who has not worked with you.

* Process Book  
  * The process book is complete and clearly documents the progress throughout the design sprint  
* Final Project Video  
  * The video can be viewed by the TAs and the maximum length is 2 minutes  
  * The video has a spoken narration that presents your data story and interactive visualizations  
  * The video and narration are appropriate for a general audience  
* Effectiveness of Visualization and Interaction Designs   
  * Proper use of colors  
  * Effective charts and visual encodings  
  * Engaging and useful interactions for the visualizations  
  * Follows the design guidelines and principles you learned in this course   
* **Technical Requirements**  
  * Implemented at least two innovative visualizations that are either  
    * a) a very creative extension of an existing visualization type, or  
    * b) a novel visualization type  
    * The goal of an innovative visualization is to go beyond typical bar charts or line charts, be creative\! Come up with custom visualizations that only work for your type of data\!  
  * Your final website should be robust, reliable, and polished
