# Assignment 2: Critical Data Zine

In this assignment, you will work in small groups (of up to 4) to grapple with how to design visualizations ethically by crafting two different, opposing perspectives to the same question posed about a single dataset. You'll then package your visualizations into a [zine](https://www.mcnutt.in/zine-potential/), which we will share with one another and peer review during a future lecture session.

## Background

It is tempting to think of data and visualization as a neutral actor, with a single "correct" set of design choices that "truthfully" *report* the data. However, outside of egregious errors (e.g., when dates are [sorted incorrectly](https://www.atlantamagazine.com/great-reads/behind-georgias-covid-19-dashboard-disaster/) or the y-axis is not [scaled uniformly](https://twitter.com/whitehouse/status/1486709480351952901)), we see that "ground truth" in data is much more contextual and situated. Design choices we make give visualization a rhetorical power that influences what a reader concludes and remembers about the data, and blurs the line between persuasion and deception. For instance, contrast Simon Scarr's [Iraq's Bloody Toll](http://www.simonscarr.com/iraqs-bloody-toll) with a [more conventional representation](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3088166/why-how-to-lie-with-statistics-did-us-a-disservice.html) of the same data, and consider why Scarr's visualization won an award while another visualization that made similar design choices—[Gun deaths in Florida](https://www.businessinsider.com/gun-deaths-in-florida-increased-with-stand-your-ground-2014-2) by Christine Chan—was widely considered to be misleading.

## Your Tasks

1. Select one dataset from [the list provided below](#datasets). These datasets are intentionally chosen to cover politically charged topics, as ethical analysis and visualization is especially critical in such situations.

2. Spend time exploring and familiarizing yourself with the dataset (e.g., through exploratory visual analysis similar to what you have done in the final project milestones). Once you feel like you've developed an understanding of the data, **devise a proposition** about it: a statement that asserts a judgement or opinion about the trends you might have uncovered. An example of a proposition might be *"Gun deaths spiked after Florida enacted its 'Stand Your Ground' law."*

   When devising your proposition, please keep in mind our goal of fostering a respectful and inclusive environment. In particular, while you are welcome to formulate controversial propositions, **propositions that demean or dehumanize people** (e.g., based on their race, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, or other aspects of their identity) **are not acceptable**. If you are unsure whether your proposition is suitable or not, please [contact the course staff](mailto:csc316-2026-01@cs.toronto.edu).

3. **Design two visualizations** to persuade a reader about each side of the proposition (i.e., one visualization should persuade the reader that the proposition is true while the other should persuade the reader that the proposition is *not* true).

   We encourage you to use whatever design choices you find produces **the most persuasive** visualization *for each side* of your proposition. You are welcome to not only use techniques we would usually consider to be *earnest* (e.g., effective and expressive encodings, transparently communicating data transformations, citing sources, etc.) but also those we might sometimes consider to be *deceptive* (e.g., violating conventions, skewed or slanted titles and labels, truncated scales and axes, filtering outliers, etc.). In doing so, you are likely to discover that there is not always a clear distinction between the two categories.

   Note, however, that this goal of persuasion also means that, **if you use any deception techniques, they should not be immediately obvious** (including to the course staff!) as they might otherwise backfire and dissuade your reader.

   For this assignment, you are free to use any visualization tools, and should carefully consider data transformation, visual encoding, textual content (i.e., titles, axes, labels), and annotations. Moreover, in this assignment, we construe "visualization" broadly (i.e., a single visualization can include several concatenated or inset charts).

4. **Bullet point your design decisions and rationale.** For each visualization, enumerate 3–5 design decisions you think are central to making the visualization persuasive (note, a "design" decision can also refer to decisions you made about data transformation or textual content). For each decision:

   1. Score, on a diverging scale from `-2` to `2`, how deceptive or earnest your decision is (where `-2` is fully deceptive, `0` is neutral, and `2` is fully earnest). Only use a score of `0` if you are really unable to decide one way or another. You may use `0.5` steps as needed.

   2. Write a couple of sentences documenting your decision, with corresponding rationale/justification. How does this decision help make your visualization persuasive? What worked well, and what didn't? What other alternatives did you consider, and why did you settle on this one?

5. **Package up your work into a zine!** Now for the fun part. You will take your work from steps 1-4 and turn it into a [zine](https://www.mcnutt.in/zine-potential/assets/web-zine.pdf). Zines have a long, and storied history for communicating specialized, unconventional, or disruptive subject matter in a DIY fashion. They've been used throughout history by dissident or marginalized groups to share information, as well as by science fiction writers, literary fans, punks, and many others! They can be remarkably effective for spreading ideas that are otherwise on the periphery of more mainstream or authoritative sources. To package up your work, please follow these steps:

   1. Please **make a copy** of this this [Canva template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAHA8GR6NEc/E-1eOdlWVckUXB60FVTrTg/edit?utm_content=DAHA8GR6NEc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton). You are free to get creative with the design (in terms of layout, graphics, and typesetting)! However, make sure you follow the correct 8-page structure. If you wish to deviate from the zine template above, please get permission from the course staff first.
 
   2. A few notes about the format. You may notice that the upper half of the template is upside-down and that the pages are in a strange order. **This is intentional!** To understand why, see this [guide on how to fold a zine](https://www.42ndstreet.org.uk/media/etdlxppk/zine-guide-colour.jpg). This simple and replicable format makes it easy to produce a lot of booklet-style zines with only flat sheets of paper, scissors, and (optionally) glue. Furthermore, note that the bottom half is divided into 4 pages, while the top half is divided into 2 rectangles. That's because your visualizations will take up a *spread* of 2 consecutive pages each. If you find it hard to work on the designs for the upside-down portion, we suggest working on them right-side-up, and then putting them in the correct (upside-down) orientation for your final submission.

   3. We will handle printing logistics for your zine after the deadline has passed. You will then fold your zines for our peer share/review the following week (Week 11).

6. After completing your zine, write a 2–3 paragraph **final reflection** on your overall design process across both visualizations and on the zine-making process. What was straightforward or difficult? What surprised you? How do you now define "ethical analysis and visualization"? What bounds (if any) can you draw to distinguish "acceptable" persuasive choices vs. "misleading" ones (and if none, why not)? This reflection will also be placed on the Back Page of your zine.

## Submission Details
Self-organize and register your group members on Markus (maximum four students per group). Your final submission should include a PDF copy of your zine, following the template from step 5. Remember that it should state your proposition, includes both visualizations and their corresponding design decisions and rationale. You should also submit your final reflection write up in PDF form. Please submit all materials to the corresponding MarkUs assignment.

## Grading

The assignment score is out of a maximum of 27 points: 11 points for each visualization, and 5 points for your write-up. Submissions that squarely meet the requirements (i.e., the "Satisfactory" column in the rubric below) will receive a score of 20. We will use the following rubric to grade your assignment. *Note:* unlike past assignments, most rubric cells do not map exactly to specific point scores because we anticipate a diversity in how you choose to apply earnest and deceptive techniques. As a result, **the staff will rely heavily on your write-up for grading this assignment** (in particular, to identify *which* techniques you used and whether you consider them an earnest or deceptive application). *Note also:* there are up to +3 bonus points available for especially creative or original zines!

| Component | Excellent | Satisfactory | Poor |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Data Transformations** *(per visualization)* | More advanced transformations (e.g., groupings, binnings, calculated fields, etc.) extend or manipulate the dataset in interesting and/or unexpected ways. *(1 point)* | The raw dataset was mostly used directly, with perhaps some simple transforms (e.g., sorting, filtering) to facilitate communicating the visualization's message. *(0 point)* | - |
| **Marks, Encodings, and Visual Design** *(per visualization)* | Visual design persuasively argues the visualization's stance (for/against the proposition), and facilitates effortless reading even when used deceptively. Any deceptive visual design choices are very subtle—even seasoned readers can only identify them on close study. *(5 points)* | Visual design is largely persuasive, but some issues hinder comprehension. Any deceptive visual design cannot be detected at first glance, but are identifiable on a second look. *(4 points)* | Visual design is distracting or makes the visualization unnecessarily or unintentionally difficult to read. Any deceptive design can be immediately identified. *(3.5 points)* |
| **Titles, Labels, and Annotations** *(per visualization)* | Titles, labels, and annotations persuasively describe, contextualize or frame the depicted data. Any slants that may be considered deceptive are imperceptible to the reader. *(5 points)* | Necessary titles and labels are present, but annotations could be better used to persuasively narrate the visualization's stance. Any deceptively slanted content is more easily detectable by readers. *(4 points)* | Several titles or labels are missing, or do not provide human-understandable information. Annotations are rarely used. Strong, charged, or colorful language makes it easy to detect deceptive content. *(3 points)* |
| **Design Rationale and Reflection** | Well crafted write-up provides reasoned justification for all design choices with a thoughtful reflection on their ethical implications. *(5 points)* | Most design decisions are described, but rationale or ethical reflections could be explained at a greater level of detail. *(4 points)* | Missing or incomplete. Several design choices are left unexplained, and/or ethical reflection is relatively shallow. *(3 points)* |
| **Zine Creativity and Originality** | You exceeded the parameters of the assignment, with creative, original or a particularly engaging zine designs. *(+3 bonus points)* | You met all the parameters of the assignment. *(0 points)* | – |

## Datasets

Please select one dataset from the options below. **You must use the same dataset for both visualizations**, but you are free to transform the data differently for each design.

- [Human Development Indicators, 1960–2020](https://github.com/vis-society/World-Bank-Data-by-Indicators). The World Bank has tracked global human development by indicators such as economy, education, environment, gender equality, health, and science and technology since 1960. The linked repository contains indicators that have been cleaned and formatted to simplify visual analysis and visualization design. However, you're also welcome to browse and use the original data [by indicator](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator) or [by country](https://data.worldbank.org/country). Click on a category to download the CSV file on the right-hand sidebar.

- [Climate Change Indicators](https://climatedata.imf.org/). Similar to the previous dataset, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) tracks a number of metrics related to climate change including greenhouse gas emissions, strategies for mitigating or adapting to the impacts of climate change, transitioning to a low-carbon economy, climate finance, and the impact on weather. The data is structured as "crosstabs" (also known as "wide" data) where every time period (e.g., quarter or year) is given its own column. To facilitate visualization and visual analysis, you might wish to [pivot the data](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/pivot.htm) into a "long" format.

- [Civilian Complaints Against New York City Police Officers](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/civilian-complaints-against-new-york-city-police-officers). This is a dataset compiled by ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit investigative journalism newsroom. It contains more than 12,000 civilian complaints filed against the NYPD, with demographic information about the complainant and officer, the category of the alleged misconduct, and the result of the complaint.

- [Abortion Data by U.S. State from the Guttmacher Institute](https://vis-society.github.io/assignments/GuttmacherInstituteAbortionDataByState.xlsx). The Guttmacher Institute is a research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights. They maintain a variety of global data related to global reproductive rights. This data set contains data about abortion rates, abortion providers, and abortion seekers, aggregated to the state level.

### Zine Inspiration

For zine design inspiration, consider: 
- Visiting the [Toronto Zine library](https://www.torontozinelibrary.org/hourslocation/) with your groupmates over the reading break. It's only open twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays so plan accordingly! 
- Browsing this [collection of zines](https://www.mcnutt.in/zine-potential/) amassed by Andrew McNutt (from the University of Utah) that have to do with visualization (broadly construed). 
- Checking out this [zine that your TA's worked on](https://zxnnic.github.io/data/pdf/ai-companion-zine.pdf) to help disseminate their research on AI companionship. (Ask one of us during your next design checkpoint if you'd like a physical copy!)
