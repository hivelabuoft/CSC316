# Design Critique & Re-Design

## Background
At this point in the semester, you have probably been told that [“visualizations are everywhere”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9) one too many times. Unfortunately for us, not all visualizations are necessarily good ones. Of course, how “good” a visualization is can be described along a number of dimensions, including encoding choices, efficiency of information extraction, or absence of chart junk, to name just a few possibilities. We have also discussed in class the elements of effective visualization and explored some of Tufte’s pioneering work in the field of information visualization. For this assignment, we will build on the skills you have developed in A1 and A2 to critique, sketch, and re-design a visualization of your choice.

## Your Tasks
Search for an example of a visualization on the Internet (it can come from a social media post, a news website, or even a blog) that you think can be improved. Analyze and critique the visualization using the vocabulary of visualization and the instructions on how to perform a design critique we have covered in lecture **(max one page)**. You should try and select a visualization that is "meaty" enough to allow you to perform a sufficiently 

Once you have finished your critique, re-design/re-implement the visualization to address some of the issues you identified in your critique. You are once again free to use any visualization technique and any visualization tool, including sketching.

## Grading
This assignment is scored out of a maximum of 10 points, evenly divided between the analysis/critique and the visualization re-design. Submissions that squarely meet the requirements will receive a score of 7. For your analysis, we will determine scores by judging the clarity, quality, and accuracy (whether the issues you point out in the visualization are actually worthy of criticism from an info-viz perspective) of your critique. For your re-design, we will determine scores by judging how well your visualization re-design addresses shortcomings identified in your analysis and in the original visualization.

As usual, we reserve the right to penalize any submissions with overly lengthy critiques; that do not meaningfully engage with the principles of design critique, etc.

## Submission Details/Checklist
This is an individual assignment. **You may not work in groups.** Your completed assignment is due on **Friday, October 24, 11:59 pm ET**. 
Submit your assignment on Markus. Make sure to include the following:
- [ ]  Your visualization analysis/critique
- [ ]  Your re-designed visualization

Once again, make sure your visualizations are sized for a reasonable viewing experience — readers should not have to zoom or scroll in order to effectively view any visualization!

## Tips and Inspiration
- Try to avoid selecting a visualization that is blatantly incorrect/unfinished as it will give you less material to meaningfully critique.
- If you cannot find the data originally used to construct the visualization you are critiquing, you may want to explain how you derived the values you use in your visualization red-esign.
- You may find the following sources helpful for finding a visualization in need of a re-design (although keep in mind the first tip about avoiding visualizations that lack substance for a critique/re-design)
    - The galleries from previous editions of the [VisLies event](https://www.vislies.org/2024/), which takes place every year at [IEEE VI](https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/welcome), the largest conference in information visualization
    - The [WTF Visualizations archive](https://viz.wtf/) although keep in mind that the archive has not been updated since 2022 and contains many low quality visualizations that likely won't give you content substantive enough for this assignment
    - The [r/chartcrimes sub-Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChartCrimes/) although the same caveat as the one above applies
