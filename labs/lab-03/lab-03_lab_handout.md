# Lab 3 Handout

### Pre-Reading Quiz
Please fill out the pre-reading quiz on Quercus at the beginning of class!

### Learning Objectives

- Be able to differentiate between *scales* and *axes*
- Understand the concept of *input domains* and *output ranges*
- Know how to create scale functions in D3
- Know how to group and transform SVG elements 
- Know how to use scales to create axes in D3

### Prerequisites

- You have read and **programmed** along with chapter 7 and 8 in *D3 - Interactive Data Visualization for the Web*.


Last week you created your first D3 visualizations. You added content to the DOM, mapped datasets to visual elements on the webpage and defined dynamic, data-dependent properties. 
This week we will focus on Scales and Axes to create visualizations that adapt dynamically to input.

## Scales

Until now, when creating a D3 visualization, we used only *x* and *y* values that corresponded directly to pixel measurements on the screen, within a pre-defined SVG drawing area. 
That is not very flexible and only feasible for static data. What if our data attributes are suddenly doubled? We can not increase the size of the chart every time a value increases. At some point, the user might have to scroll through a simple bar chart to get all the information.

→ This is where ***scales*** come in. We specify a fixed SVG drawing space in our webpage and scale the data to fit in the dedicated area.

> D3 provides built-in methods for many different scales: linear, ordinal, logarithmic, square root etc. Most of the time you will use *linear scale functions* , so we will focus on learning this type of scale.

*"Scales are functions that map from an input domain to an output range." (Mike Bostock)*

*Example:* We want to visualize the monthly sales of an ice cream store. The input data are numbers between 0 and 20,000 USD and the maximum height of the chart is 400px. We take an input inverval (called ***Domain***) and transform it into a new output interval (called ***Range***).

![Scales](assets/cs171-scales.png?raw=true "Scales")

We could transform the numbers from one domain into the other manually but what if the sales rise above 20.000 and the interval changes? That means a lot of manual work. Thankfully, we can use D3's built-in scaling methods to do this automatically.


### Scaling in D3

D3 provides scale functions to convert the *input domain* to an *output range*. We can specify the domain and range by using *method chaining syntax*:

```javascript
// Creating a scale function
let iceCreamScale = d3.scaleLinear()
	.domain([0, 20000])
	.range([0, 400]);

// Call the function and pass an input value
iceCreamScale(5000);	// Returns: 100
``` 
This was pretty easy, because we already knew the max value of the data. What if we load data from an external source and don't know the data range the data is going to be in? Instead of specifying fixed values for the domain, we can use the convenient array functions ```d3.min()```, ```d3.max()``` or ```d3.extent()```.

```javascript
let quarterlyReport = [
	{ month: "May", sales: 6900 },
	{ month: "June", sales: 14240 },
	{ month: "July", sales: 25000 },
	{ month: "August", sales: 17500 }
];

// Returns the maximum value in a given array (= 25000)
let max = d3.max(quarterlyReport, function(d) {
	return d.sales;
});

// Returns the minimum value in a given array (= 6900)
let min = d3.min(quarterlyReport, function(d) {
	return d.sales;
});

// Returns the min. and max. value in a given array (= [6900,25000])
let extent = d3.extent(quarterlyReport, function(d) {
	return d.sales;
});
```

## SVG Groups

In the last lab you have learned how to create basic SVG shapes, like rectangles or circles. But there is another SVG element that is very useful for programming in D3: the group element (```<g></g>```). In contrast to graphical elements the group element does not have a visual presence, but it helps you to organize other elements and to apply *transformations*. In this way, you can create hierarchical structures. 

```javascript
// Create group element
let group = svg.append("g");

// Append circle to the group
let circle = group.append("circle")
	.attr("r", 4)
	.attr("fill", "blue");
```
Group elements are invisible but you can apply transformations, for example *translate()* or *rotate()*, to the group and it will affect the rendering of **all child elements**! 

```javascript
// Group element with 'transform' attribute
// x = 70, y = 50 (...moves the whole group 70px to the right and 50px down)
let group = svg.append("g")
	.attr("transform", "translate(70, 50)");
```

## Axes

*The current visualization does not really look like a scatterplot yet. It is just a bunch of circles that are nicely arranged. We need x- and y-axes to allow the user to actually extract meaningful insights from the visualization.*

→ An ***axis*** is the visual representation of a scale.

D3 provides four methods to create axes with different orientations and label placements (d3.axisTop, d3.axisBottom, d3.axisLeft, and d3.axisRight) which can display reference lines for D3 scales automatically. These axis components contain lines, labels and ticks.

```javascript
// Create a horizontal axis with labels placed below the axis
let xAxis = d3.axisBottom();

// Pass in the scale function
xAxis.scale(xScale);
```

The above is equivalent to:

```javascript
let xAxis = d3.axisBottom()
	.scale(xScale);
```

Finally, to add the axis to the SVG graph, we need to specify the position in the DOM tree and then we have to *call* the axis function.

We create an SVG group element as a selection and use the *call()* function to hand it off to the *xAxis* function. All the axis elements are getting generated within that group.

```javascript
// Draw the axis
svg.append("g")
	.attr("class", "axis x-axis")
	.call(xAxis);
```
![D3 Axis 1](assets/cs171-d3-axis-1.png?raw=true "D3 Axis 1")

Recall that we can use the *transform* attribute to change the position and move the axis to the bottom. 

```javascript
// Draw the axis
svg.append("g")
	.attr("class", "axis x-axis")
	.attr("transform", "translate(0," + (height - padding) + ")")
	.call(xAxis);
```

Additionally, you can use the HTML *class* property as a selector and modify the style with CSS:

```css
.axis path,
.axis line {
	fill: none;
	stroke: #333;
	shape-rendering: crispEdges;
}

.axis text {
	font-family: sans-serif;
	font-size: 11px;
}
```

*```shape-rendering``` is an SVG property which specifies how the SVG elements are getting rendered. We have used it in this example to make sure that we don't get blurry axes.*

### Refine the axis

D3 axis functions automatically adjust the spacing and labels for a given scale and range. Depending on the data and the type of the visualization you may want to modify these settings.

```javascript
let xAxis = d3.axisBottom()
	.scale(xScale)
	// Add options here
```

*There are many different options to customize axes:*

- Number of ticks: ```.ticks(5)```
- Tick format, e.g. as percentage: ```.tickFormat(d3.format(".0%"))``` 	
- Tick values: ```.tickValues([0, 10, 20, 30, 40])```

You can read more about D3 axis, ticks and tick formatting in the *D3 API reference*:

## More about D3 Scales

### Other Quantitative Scales

- ```d3.scaleSqrt()``` 	- Square root scale
- ```d3.scalePow()``` 		- Power scale
- ```d3.scaleLog()``` 		- Logarithmic scale

### Ordinal Scales

In the previous examples we have used only quantitative scales but D3 also provides methods to create ordinal scales with a discrete domain.

```javascript
// Create an ordinal scale function
let xScale = d3.scaleBand()
	.domain(["May", "June", "July", "August"])
	.range([0, 400]) // D3 fits n (=4) bands within this interval
	.paddingInnder(0.05);	// Adds spacing between bands
```

*For example, D3's ordinal scales can be very useful to simplify the positioning of bars in a bar chart.*

### Color Scales

D3 has built-in color palettes that work like ordinal scales and can also be accessed like other scales:

*Examples:*

- ```d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory10)``` -  ordinal scale with a range of 10 categorical colors
- ```d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory20)``` -  ordinal scale with a range of 20 categorical colors


```javascript
// Construct a new ordinal scale with a range of ten categorical colors
let colorPalette = d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory10);

// Print color range
console.log(colorPalette.range());
// ["#1f77b4", "#ff7f0e", "#2ca02c", "#d62728", "#9467bd", "#8c564b", "#e377c2", "#7f7f7f", "#bcbd22", "#17becf"]

// Specify domain (optional)
colorPalette.domain(["Vanilla", "Cookies", "Chocolate", "Pistachio"]);

// Use color palette
colorPalette("Chocolate") // Returns: #2ca02c
```

Instead of using a fixed range of colors you can use linear scale functions to create color gradients: 

```javascript
let linearColor = d3.scaleLinear()
  .domain([0,100])
  .range(["darkgreen","lightgreen"]);

linearColor(0)		// Returns: #006400
linearColor(50)		// Returns: #48a948
linearColor(100) 	// Returns: #90ee90
```

## The D3 Margin Convention

Positioning the axes or defining the correct spacing between the components can be cumbersome. Earlier in this lab we suggested an easy solution by using a *padding* variable. This was convenient for our type of chart but especially for larger visualizations you should use a global margin object, with individual spacings for all directions. 

> By convention, margins in D3 are specified as an object with top, right, bottom and left properties. Then, the outer size of the chart area, which includes the margins, is used to compute the inner size available for graphical marks by subtracting the margins. *(Mike Bostock)*

![D3 Margin Convention](assets/cs171-margin-convention.png?raw=true "Margin Convention")

*Please take some time to look at the recommended sequence by Mike Bostock:*

```javascript
// Margin object with properties for the four directions
let margin = {top: 20, right: 10, bottom: 20, left: 10};

// Width and height as the inner dimensions of the chart area
let width = 960 - margin.left - margin.right,
    height = 500 - margin.top - margin.bottom;

// Define 'svg' as a child-element (g) from the drawing area and include spaces
let svg = d3.select("body").append("svg")
    .attr("width", width + margin.left + margin.right)
    .attr("height", height + margin.top + margin.bottom)
    .append("g")
    .attr("transform", "translate(" + margin.left + "," + margin.top + ")");
    
// All subsequent functions/properties can ignore the margins:
let x = d3.scaleLinear()
	.range([0, width]);

let y = d3.scaleLinear()
    .range([height, 0]);
```
