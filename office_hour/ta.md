## 5. Monitoring the Queue During Office Hours

**Pro Tips:**

- Keep Zoom and QueueStatus open side by side for easy management.
- Check the **Notes** column for any special instructions from students.

## 6. Admitting Students to Zoom

- **Admit only the student currently first in line** to maintain privacy.
- When finished, **remove the student from Zoom** before admitting the next.
- QueueStatus will automatically move the next student up.

**If the first student is not ready:**

- Look for a note like “BRB 10 mins.”
- You can temporarily help the next student while keeping the first in the queue.

## 7. Ending the Session & Closing the Queue

1. When office hours end, **close the queue** so no new students can join.
2. Remove any remaining students from Zoom.
3. Optionally, leave a **QueueStatus note** for follow-up if needed.
