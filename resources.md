### Visualization Toolkits
A variety of useful toolkits have been designed to help support information visualization applications. Some include support for the full visualization pipeline from data to interactive graphics, while others focus only on a subset, typically graphics and interaction.
* [D3](https://d3js.org) – A JavaScript library for data-driven DOM manipulation, interaction and animation. Includes utilities for visualization techniques and SVG generation.
* [Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega) – A declarative language for representing visualizations. Vega will parse a visualization specification to produce a JavaScript-based visualization, using either HTML Canvas or SVG rendering. Vega is particularly useful for creating programs that produce visualizations as output.
* [Vega-Lite](http://vega.github.io/vega-lite) – A high-level visualization grammar that compiles concise specifications to full Vega specifications.
* [Processing](http://processing.org/) or [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) – A popular Java-like graphics and interaction language and IDE. Processing has a strong user community with many examples. p5.js is a sister project in JavaScript.
* [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) – an open-source C++ graphics library popular for video and media installations, similar approach to Processing.
* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) – a popular open-source mapping library
* [VTK](http://www.vtk.org/) – A scientific visualization library (C++ with wrappers for other languages)
* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) – built on top of D3, offers abstractions that enable building interactive visualizations very quickly with well-known charts.
* [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) – designed for high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets in web browsers. By Anaconda team.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) – A Python-based visualization library with visually defensible defaults that builds on [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org).
* [Chroma.js](https://vis4.net/chromajs/) – A color-math library for JavaScript capable of generating perceptually uniform color mappings.

### Exploratory Visualization Tools
* [Tableau for Students](http://www.tableausoftware.com/student/) – get a free Tableau license as a student
* [Tableau Public](http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/) – a free version of Tableau which publishes to the web
* [Raw Graphs](https://www.rawgraphs.io/) – an interactive chart generator supporting many, many visualization types
* [GGplot2](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/) – a graphics language for [R](http://www.r-project.org/)
* [Voyager](http://vega.github.io/voyager2) – web-based data exploration tools from UW’s Interactive Data Lab
* [GGobi](http://www.ggobi.org/) – classic system for visualizations of multivariate data
* [Observable Plot](https://github.com/observablehq/plot) – A concise JavaScript API for exploratory data visualization (from the authors of D3).

### Tableau Resources
* [Tableau Training](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training): Specifically the _Getting Started_ video and _Visual Analytics_ section. Most helpful when first getting off the ground.
* [Build-It-Yourself Exercises](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/help.html#dataview_examples.html): Specifically, sections _Build Charts and Analyze Data_ > _Build Common / Advanced Chart Types_, and _Build Data Views From Scratch > Analyze Data_ are a good documentation resource.
* [Drawing With Numbers](http://rawingwithnumbers.artisart.org/): blog with example walkthroughs in the _Visualizations_ section, and _Tableau Wiki_ has a bunch of useful links for the most common advanced exploratory / visualization Tableau techniques.

### D3 Resources
* [D3 In Depth](https://d3indepth.com/): Code notebook/textbook-like blog that aims to bridge intro textbooks and D3 official documentation.
* [D3: Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/13137514): O’Reilly book available online through CU libraries.
* [Observable D3 Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery): D3 templates and examples organized by type, mostly authored by Bostock, e.g. [Methods of Comparison Compared](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/methods-of-comparison-compared)
* [Observable Visualization Collection](https://observablehq.com/collection/@observablehq/visualization): D3@V5 showcase from Bostock as well as many others.
* [Observable Forums](https://talk.observablehq.com/): includes tips specific to Observable platform, e.g. [How to load css files](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/how-to-load-css-files/101/2)
* [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/): a static-site generator with the same ‘reactive cell’ logic as Observable Notebooks, allowing you to have greater control over the markup & styling and the ability to self-host what you create
